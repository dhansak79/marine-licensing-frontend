Help with eastings and northings formats
{% endset %}

{% set detailsHTML %}
    <p>How accurate your eastings and northings coordinates are, depends on how many digits you use for each:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>2 + 2 digits (4 in total) - accurate to 1 square kilometre</li>
      <li>3 + 3 digits (6 in total) - accurate to 100 square metres</li>
      <li>4 + 4 digits (8 in total) - accurate to 10 square metres</li>
	  <li>6 + 6 digits (12 in total) - accurate to 1 square metre</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some places further north, such as the Shetland Islands, may need 7 digits for the northing coordinate.</p>
    <p>Enter 2 values, each with at least 6 digits - one for eastings and one for northings. For example, 123456, 654321.</p>
    <p>Always enter eastings first, then northings, in their separate fields.</p>
{% endset %}

{% block introText %}
    <p>Eastings and northings should only include numbers. For example: 123456, 654321.</p>
