<p>How accurate your eastings and northings coordinates are, depends on how many digits you use for each:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>2 + 2 digits (4 in total) - accurate to 10 square kilometres</li>
  <li>3 + 3 digits (6 in total) - accurate to 1 square kilometre</li>
  <li>4 + 4 digits (8 in total) - accurate to 100 square metres</li>
  <li>5 + 5 digits (10 in total) - accurate to 10 square metres</li>
  <li>6 + 6 digits (12 in total) - accurate to 1 square metre</li>
</ul>
<p>Some places further north, such as the Shetland Islands, may need 7 digits for the northing coordinate.</p>
<p>Enter 2 values, each with at least 6 digits - one for eastings and one for northings. For example, 438493, 569648.</p>
<p>Always enter eastings first, then northings, in their separate fields.</p>
